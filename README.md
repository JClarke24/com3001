This directory contains the source code for the final year project titled:
"What are the effects of using genetic algorithms to optimize a neural network to play connect-four?"

All of the code was written and tested using the PyCharm IDE and using Python version 3.9 as interpreter.

I have created a main.py function which trains and evaluates a simply NN model to play connect-4.
The "ga" directory contains the files of the second part of the project which consists of optimizing a population of NN to play connect-4.
Both the gaAlg and gaAlg2 Python scripts contain the code for optimizing the model in two different ways, as covered in the report.

This project does require some libraries to be installed on the machine before compilation. I created a PyCharm virtual environment on my machine to install these:
"pip3 install keras"
"pip3 install tensorflow"
"pip3 install scikit-learn"

Once this is done, the code should be ready for use.
